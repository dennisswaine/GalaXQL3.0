1.As your very first task, use SQL to calculate the number of seconds in one 
day (where day is 24 hours, hour is 60 minutes and a minute is 60 seconds).

SELECT (60*60)*24

2.Let's see if you can build a query now. Get x, y and z information from all 
the rows from the table 'stars'.

SELECT x,y,z FROM stars

3.Make a query which returns starid, x, y and z for all stars where x is 
greater than zero and starid is less than one hundred. Sort the results by 
the y-coordinate so that the smallest values come first.

SELECT starid, x, y, z FROM stars 
WHERE x > 0 AND starid < 100
ORDER BY y

4.Build a query where you calculate the sum of all y values divided by all x 
values.

SELECT sum(y/x) FROM stars

5.Hilight five stars which have star id between 5000 and 15000, and have class 7. (Hint: don't try to do this with a single query at this point).

SELECT * from stars WHERE class = 7 AND starid > 5000 AND starid < 15000 - to find which stars to hilight

INSERT INTO hilight VALUES (5007);
INSERT INTO hilight VALUES (5106);
INSERT INTO hilight VALUES (5625);
INSERT INTO hilight VALUES (7956);
INSERT INTO hilight VALUES (8643);
